Waterfall ( Framework )
	- Software Development Life Cycle
	- 30-40% of the efforts goes to Upfront Design ( Architeture )
	- When the requirements are stable
	- Customer knows the final outcome of the product
	- Customer & Developement Team has clear vision of how the final product
	  is going to look or come out
	- The complete development will be done, then tested and then delivered to
	  the customer
	- The feedback about the product will arrive at the very end of product
	  release

Agile
	- What is Agile?
	- Fail Fast Methodology
		- When things go wrong, you wanted a feedback about it immediately
		  rather than after couple of months/weeks
	- an ability to adapt and respond quickly to customer' requirement
	- The kind of the products that are developed today are very complex
	- The customer knows only the about the next 10-15 features that will be
	  developed in 2-3 months.
	- The customer will come up with new ideas as the product evolves over time
	- The development team will not the know the final out come of the product
	  at the end of 5 years
	- The requirements keep changing
	- is a practice 
	- Agile Frameworks ( SCRUM, Kanban, XP )


SCRUM
	- is an Agile Framework
	- The product development is divided into several Sprints
	- In a Sprint, only limited number of features will be developed
		- Duration - Between 1 week(5 days) to 4 week
	- SCRUM Team size
		Ideally - 4~5 (co-located)
		Practically - 10~15 Members 
	- Assuming the Sprint duration is 1 week ( Mon-Friday )
		Mon - Sprint starts
		Fri - Sprint is delivered

	- Each feature is called as a "User Story".
	- EPIC is a very big feature that could be broken down into many "User Stories".

SCRUM Roles
	- Product Owner (PO)
		- could be real customer or acts as an internal customer 
		- in certain cases the Product Owner is seen an internal customer, hence
		  the Product is the one who actually interacts with the end-customer
		- is the person who will decide the priority of the features
		- he is the one who gives requirement
		- he is the one who sponsors the work
		- he has the final authority on any key decisions that affects the product 
	- SCRUM Master (SM)
		- he/she is master of SCRUM processes
		- is a facilitator
		- this person is also some times referred as Team Servant
		- should have strong communication and persuading skills
		- SCRUM Master is a person who will constantly interact with all the Development Team Members, Product Owner
	- Development Team
		- Project Manager
		- Architect
		- Tech Leads ( Subject Matter Experts - SMEs )
		- Project Leads
		- Developers
		- Quality Assurance Engineers
	- Functional Analyst ( Optional Role )
		- Domain Experts, need not be a technical person 
		- Collects requirements from Product Owners and converts the requirements
		  into User Stories with Acceptance Criterias by discussing on a regular fashion with the Product Owner.
		- He/She is the one who adds requirements to Product Backlog

Slicing
	- Breaking the EPIC into stories
	- Slicing of features/user stories should be done in a such a way
	  that features delivered in each sprint provies some minimum business value to the
	  customer

SPRINT 
	- the development team pics a certain number of user stories in each sprint
	- the Product is the one who provides the priority
	- however the team decides which all dependent features that should be done
	  in a sprint
	- the user stories are estimated based story points ( Story Point Estimation )
	- Each user story is estimated or categorised as listed depending the complexity a
	  and efforts required to complete. Relative Estimation technique
		- Tiny ( 1 story point )
		- Small ( 2 story points )
		- Medium ()
		- Large
		- Extra Large
	- The velocity of each Sprint Team may vary dependending on various factors like
			- their industry experience
			- how much skilled they are in a particular technology
			- domain expertise
	- Based on the velocity of the team, the team will decide the no of stories 
	  that can be delivered in a sprint

Product Backlog
	- Whatever requirements are given by the Product Owner that gets added to 
	  the Product Backlog
	- The items (features/user stories/EPICs) that are added to the Product Backlog
	  are called as Product Backlog Items (PBI)

Velocity
	- is the speed with which the team can complete user stories
	- depends on the team size
	- depends on team's industry experience
	- depends on domain experience

SCRUM Ceremonies ( Meetings )
	- Daily Stand-up meeting
		- fail-fast meeting ( feedbacks are shared more frequently - good/bad)
			- damage control
		- inspect and adapt meeting
			- the team compares their actual progress against their plan
			- if the team sees a risk, they will immediate communicate the issue
			  to the Product Owner
		- They what you did yesterday
		- How things worked out yesterday
		- Are there any obstacles?
		- What you are planning to do it?

	- Product Backlog Grooming Meeting
			- The development team meets on a particular day & time regularly
			  and review all the Product Backlog Item to understand and verify if
			  the required and clear and complete
			- Every user story should have an Acceptance Criteria
			- Acceptance Criteria
					- Test cases that prove that the customer agrees that he/she
					  got what they really wanted
					- The test scenerios
					- Expected behavior/result/response of a user story for a  specific input
			- User story without Acceptance Criteria is considered as incomplete
			- They also reject or clear certain invalid requirments
			- If the Product Backlog keeps growing badly
			- The size of Product Backlog must be kept healthy
				- Need not be empty at the same time shouldn't be growing faster
			- If the team velocity is healthy then naturally the Product Backlog size will reduce faster

	- Sprint Planning
		- The Development Team along with SCRUM Master attends this meeting
		- They plan what all user stories can be picked up in the next upcoming
		  sprint based on the priority defined by Product Owner
		- The number of the stories that can be picked up in a Sprint depends on Team's velocity

	- Sprint Retrospective
		- Once the Sprint is delivered, all the team members meet and discuss
	      what all went well in the last sprint, what could be improved, how to
	      void certain troubles that they faced
	    - they wanted to record the good things so that other teams can follow
	    - they also wanted to record bads things and ways to prevent/tackle/avoid the issue moving forward
	    - Post Mortem Meeting ( Root Cause Analysis Meeting)
	    	- intension is to improve things moving forward

	- Sprint Demo
		- In this once the Sprint is complete, the team gives a demo to
		  the Product Owner
		- All the Acceptance Criterias are verified to see if the requirements
		  are implemented as per customer's expectations

	- Definition of Done
		- This is defined by Product Owner
		- Explains what are the criterias a Sprint should fulfil to consider
		  the Sprint or Work is done
		  	- Acceptance Criteria should be met
